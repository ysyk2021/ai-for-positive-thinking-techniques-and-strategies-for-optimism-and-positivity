### Emotional AI

Emotional AI involves using AI algorithms to detect and respond to human emotions. This technology has great potential for enhancing positive thinking practices by providing personalized feedback and coaching based on an individual's emotional state.

For example, an AI-powered app could detect when an individual is feeling stressed or anxious and provide interventions such as meditation or breathing exercises to help them achieve a more positive mindset.

### Virtual Humans

Virtual humans are AI-powered avatars that can interact with humans in a realistic and natural way. These virtual humans can be used to provide personalized coaching and guidance for positive thinking practices.

For example, a virtual human coach could provide personalized recommendations and interventions for positive thinking based on an individual's unique needs and preferences.

### Gamification

Gamification involves applying game design principles to non-game contexts to engage and motivate individuals. Gamification can be used to enhance positive thinking practices by making them more enjoyable and engaging.

For example, an AI-powered app could use gamification to encourage individuals to practice positive thinking regularly by providing rewards and incentives for completing certain tasks or achieving specific goals.

### Augmented Reality

Augmented reality involves overlaying digital information onto the physical world. This technology can be used to enhance positive thinking practices by providing visual cues and prompts to help individuals maintain a positive mindset.

For example, an AI-powered augmented reality app could display positive affirmations or images throughout the day to help individuals stay focused on their goals and maintain an optimistic outlook.
